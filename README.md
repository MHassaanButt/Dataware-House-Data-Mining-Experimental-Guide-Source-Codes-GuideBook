# Dataware-House-Data-Mining-Experimental-Guide-Source-Codes-GuideBook-Video-Demo-
The aim of this repository to guide the new students who wants to learn how basic algorithms of data mining (Apriori, Kmeans and KNN etc) are implemented.

I wrote this guide book while studying in my master's at Southwest Jiaotong University during my course of dataware house and data mining. A feel lot of students have trouble in using tools for first time. 

I wrote a proper complete guidebook for beginners the pdf file which explain every step and the solution of problems we face while implementing algorithms.

I also upladed the source code of Apriori, Kmeans, KNN and other algorithms implemented in C# using Visual Studio and MY SQL Server Management Studio.

Also uploaded the video demo and link is here: 

If you still face any problem in implemention of algorithms feel fry to contact me.
